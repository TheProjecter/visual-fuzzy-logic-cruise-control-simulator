# Requirements #

You'll need two huge libs, media files and misc stuff:
  * [Ogre3D 1.7.x](http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk)
  * [CEGUI 0.7.5](http://www.cegui.org.uk/wiki/index.php/CEGUI_Downloads_0.7.5)
  * media files and misc stuff are included in the release at the [Downloads](https://code.google.com/p/visual-fuzzy-logic-cruise-control-simulator/downloads/list) section

Btw, I've recently ported the code from gcc-4.5.2-tdm (Ogre3D 1.7.2 for GCC was compiled against the dw2 version it seems) to VS2008 with no problems. Both libs have SDKs available for many platforms :)
